            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PROTESTATION OF THE LORDS Upon rejecting the <hi>Impeachment</hi> of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Harris. March</hi> 28. 1681.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe that in all Ages it hath been an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted Right</hi> of the <hi>Commons,</hi> to impeach before the <hi>Lords,</hi> any Subject, for <hi>Treaſons,</hi> or any Crime what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; and the reaſon is, becauſe great Offences that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the <hi>Parliament,</hi> are moſt effectually determined in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot reject the Impeachment of the Commons, becauſe that Suit or Complaint can be determined no where elſe: For, if the Party Impeached ſhould be Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench,</hi> or in any other Court, for the ſame Offence, yet it is not the ſame Suit; for an <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is at the Suit of the <hi>People,</hi> and they have an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in it, but an <hi>Inditement</hi> is at the Suit of the <hi>King:</hi> For, one and the ſame Offence may intitle ſeveral Perſons to ſeveral Suits; as, if a Murder be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the King may indite at his Suit, and the Heir, or the Wife of the Party murdered may bring an
<note n="*" place="margin">Which is alwayes to be preferred, and upon notice thereof, all Proſecutions at the Suit of the King is to ſtop, till the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution at the Suit of the Party be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</note> Appeal; and the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not releaſe that Appeal, nor his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement prevent the Proceedings in the Appeal; becauſe the Appeal is the Suit of the Party, and he hath an Intereſt in it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:98677:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>It is, as we conceive, an <hi>abſolute Denial of Juſtice,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, as it is ſaid before, the ſame Suit cannot be tryed any where elſe. The Houſe of <hi>Peers,</hi> as to <hi>Impeachments,</hi> proceed by virtue of their <hi>Judicial Power,</hi> and not by their <hi>Legiſlative;</hi> and as to that, act as a <hi>Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> and can deny Suitors (eſpecially the <hi>Commons of England,</hi> that bring <hi>Legal Complaint</hi> before them) no more than the Juſtices of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or other Courts can deny any <hi>Suit</hi> or <hi>Criminal Cauſe,</hi> that is regularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced before them.</p>
            <p>Our Law ſaith, in the Perſon of the King, <hi>Nulli nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimus Juſtitiam,</hi> we will deny Juſtice to no ſingle Perſon; yet here, as we apprehend; Juſtice is denied to the whole Body of the People; this may be interpreted, an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and will, as we fear, have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh Government,</hi> and be an Incouragement to all inferiour Courts, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the ſame <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> by denying the Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Grand Juries,</hi> &amp;c. for which, at this time, the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſtands impeached in the <hi>Houſe of Peers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Proceedings may miſrepreſent the <hi>Houſe of Peers</hi> to the King and People, eſpecially, at this time; and the more, in the particular Caſe of <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> who is publickly known to be concerned in vile and horrid Treaſons againſt his Majeſty, and a great Conſpirator in the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> to murder the <hi>King,</hi> and deſtroy and ſubvert the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
